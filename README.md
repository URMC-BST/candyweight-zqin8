<!-- ## Setting up github access from rstudio (ignore this until 30 August 2021!)

1.  Let git know about your github username and email:
   ```r
   usethis::use_git_config(
  scope = "user",
  user.name = "your-github-email@example.com",
  user.email = "your-github-username"
)
   ```
   replacing the `your-github` bits with the email and username you have registered on github.com.-->
<!-- From the rstudio Terminal, replacing your email/username below, run the following commands:
    git config --global user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
2.  Generate a personal authentication token.  First, read through the [TL;DR instructions here](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/git-credentials.html).  Then use the following commands:
   ```r
   usethis::create_github_token()
   gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
   ```
Save this in a password manager, as you may need to reenter it ~ once daily.
